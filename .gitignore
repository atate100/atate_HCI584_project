# API key file: Do NOT hardcode API keys in any code file that will end up on github! Others can (mis-)use it and everything on github lives forever! Instead do this:

    # put your key(s) into a keys.py file and read them in as strings at the start of your main program (See refresher 6, data storage)
    # put keys.py at the top of your .gitignore file, this means it will not ever accidentally end up on github.

#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
